## Introduction
This example shows how to train a [DQN (Deep Q Networks)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)  agent on the Cartpole environment using the TF-Agents library.

![Cartpole environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/agents/master/docs/tutorials/images/cartpole.png)

This example is run inside the Google Colab [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). The Jupyter notebook, `DQN_Tutorial.ipynb`, is included in the github repo.

## Results
**Trained Agent**

Please see file `trained-agent.mp4` in the github repo.

**Random Agent**

Please see file `random-agent.mp4` in the github repo.

As seen in the video, the trained agent performs much better than the random agent.
