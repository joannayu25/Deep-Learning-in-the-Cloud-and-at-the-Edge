## Introduction
This example shows how to train a [DQN (Deep Q Networks)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)  agent on the Cartpole environment using the TF-Agents library.

![Cartpole environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/agents/master/docs/tutorials/images/cartpole.png)

This example is run inside the Google Colab [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

## Results
**Trained Agent**
![trained agent](trained-agent.mp4)

**Random Agent**
![random agent](random-agent.mp4)

As seen in the video, the trained agent performs much better than the random agent.
